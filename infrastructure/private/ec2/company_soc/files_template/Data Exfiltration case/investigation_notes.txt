Date: 2025-05-10  
Analyst: K. Marciniak  

Initial Detection:
- SCP data transfer to external IP (non-whitelisted)  
- Total size: ~1.2 GB  
- Source: internal host 192.168.56.42  
- User: j.kowalski (??)

Checks:
✓ User login confirmed at 23:44  
✓ Downloaded archive: client_data.zip (known internal file)  
✓ File transferred via SCP/SFTP to IP 51.91.132.77  
✗ No business justification found (checked ticketing system)  
✓ External IP not owned by company  
✗ No audit trail of prior approval  

→ Open question: was this malicious, or negligence?
→ Does the contestant know the flag?  
→ Is j.kowalski's account compromised? Insider?  

Next steps:

[ ] Verify IP reputation of 51.91.132.77  
[ ] Isolate host for forensic imaging  
[ ] Review prior access to /srv/backups/
