Case ID: USB-2019-084
Date Opened: 2019-10-18
Analyst: K. Zalewski

Incident Summary:
A USB device found in the company parking lot was plugged into a workstation by an unaware employee.
The device executed an unknown binary immediately after mounting, suggesting autorun-style exploitation.
Initial infection appears to have established persistence via registry modification and dropped multiple payloads.
