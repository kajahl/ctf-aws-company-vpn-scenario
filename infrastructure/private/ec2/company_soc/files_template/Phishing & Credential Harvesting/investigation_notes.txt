CASE: SOC-PH-0129  
Date: 2025-05-09  
Analyst: M. Zielińska  

Initial Trigger:
- Unusual login from IP 185.112.145.88 (Russia)
- Belongs to no known VPNs or whitelisted providers
- Followed by brief session access to inbox/archive

Findings:
✓ DNS logs show access to suspicious domain: login-micr0s0ft-security.com  
✓ User submitted credentials via POST (confirmed via proxy logs)  
✓ Email headers spoof Microsoft domain — clear phishing  
✓ Email not caught by anti-spam filters (new domain?)

Actions Taken:
✓ User a.nowak account locked  
✓ SOC added IOC to detection engine  
✓ Domain reported to registrar (pending takedown)  
✓ Proxy rule updated to block *.micr0s0ft-security.com

To Investigate:
[ ] Did attacker forward or download any messages?  
[ ] Was this part of a wider phishing campaign?  
[ ] Who else received similar e-mail?

Note:
→ Domain uses typosquatting (0 instead of "o")  
→ Second domain fonts-banking.net also used in phishing page assets
