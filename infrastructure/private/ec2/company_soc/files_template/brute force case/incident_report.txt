=== INCIDENT REPORT ===  
CASE ID: SOC-BF-0081  
Date: 2025-05-11  
Prepared by: J. Nowak  
Classification: Internal Threat (suspected)

---

Summary:
At 02:14 on 2025-05-11, automated detection systems flagged repeated failed login attempts on the FTP service hosted at 192.168.56.20. A total of 52 login attempts were observed from IP address 192.168.56.101 over a span of ~1 minute. The activity matched the signature for brute force behavior.

---

Timeline (UTC+2):

• 02:14:22 – Initial FTP connection from 192.168.56.101  
• 02:14:23–02:14:31 – Multiple failed login attempts using common usernames  
• 02:14:56 – vsftpd logs indicate login failure threshold exceeded  
• 02:15:01 – IP 192.168.56.101 automatically banned by fail2ban  
• 02:15:03 – auditd logs confirm anomaly event  
• 02:15:04 – Alert registered as SOC-BF-0081

Affected Systems:
- soc-ftp-server (192.168.56.20)  
- No evidence of successful authentication  
- No files were accessed or exfiltrated (as per current evidence)

---

Attack Vector:
- Brute-force login attempts over FTP (port 21)  
- Usernames used: admin, root, guest, analyst, etc.  
- NOTE: The username "analyst" suggests possible internal recon or leaked credential knowledge

---

Root Cause:
- FTP service was publicly accessible within internal subnet  
- Lack of login attempt rate limiting (mitigated post-incident)

---

Recommendations:
1. Review and restrict access to FTP service (internal use only)
2. Enforce strong credential policies and remove default/unused accounts
3. Implement stricter brute-force detection thresholds
4. Audit existence and usage of account: analyst
5. Investigate whether similar behavior occurred from other IPs in 192.168.56.0/24

---

Status:
Under Review  
Awaiting deeper correlation with historical cases (e.g. SOC-BF-0079)  
Next review scheduled: 2025-05-12 @ 09:00
