CASE ID: SOC-BF-0081  
Date opened: 2025-05-11  
Analyst: J. Nowak  

Initial Alert:
→ Alert generated by FTP brute force rule (SID:1000453)
→ Triggered ~02:14 AM, source IP 192.168.56.101
→ 50+ failed login attempts within 60 seconds

Observed usernames used during attempts:
- admin
- root
- guest
- user
- analyst (??)
- test
- sysadmin
- dev
* NOTE: 'analyst' might indicate attacker has some knowledge of internal accounts??

Source IP: 192.168.56.101  
Reverse DNS: ❌ (no hostname)  
Internal asset? Unconfirmed — needs network map check  
GeoIP lookup: private range → likely internal

Action Taken:
✓ IP temporarily banned via fail2ban  
✓ Alert forwarded to case system  
✓ FTP logs saved to archive  
✓ Auditd flagged anomaly for excessive login failures

To Do:
[ ] Check if attacker eventually succeeded — any successful login?  
[ ] Correlate with other logs: SMB? SSH?  
[ ] Check if user 'analyst' exists and if creds are reused elsewhere  
[ ] Investigate traffic during 02:14 - 02:16 (pcap exists?)

Misc:
→ Might be test scan from Red Team? But no notification  
→ User 'backup' tried once, could be enum script  
→ Look for connection to SOC-BF-0079 (similar pattern, same subnet?)
